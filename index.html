To better assist them in their careers, I have deliberately studied diverse skills such as design, marketing, consulting, business analysis, and unlocking potentials.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>In my previous career, I accumulated practical experience in design, systems, and marketing management, particularly during my tenure at Elite Acres Sdn Bhd. Here, I was involved in planning the systematic operation of hotel operations, leveraging my expertise in UI/UX design and marketing strategy development. To accomplish the task, I took the initiative to find solutions and began learning coding, creating a static website and an internal community system, significantly improving efficiency within the organization.</p>
            <p>I realized that design isn't just about making things look beautiful. It involves aligning with the entire business operation, understanding customer needs, creating seamless experiences, enhancing company culture, and branding, and aligning with sales strategies to ensure profitability.</p>
